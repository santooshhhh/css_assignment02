            <p>Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow<br>
            I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow<br>
            I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow<br>
            Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know</p>

            I'll settle for the ghost of you<br>
            I miss you more than life (More than life)<br>
            And if you can't be next to me<br>
            Your memory is ecstasy<br>
            I miss you more than life<br>

            I need more time, but time can't be borrowed<br>
            I'd leave it all behind if I could follow<br>
            Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know</p>
